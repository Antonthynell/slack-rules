Slack Guidelines
================

 1. Be civil

For Donors
----------

 1. Projects marked "internal" and "beta" are not guaranteed to receive accurate credit. "internal" projects may not recieve any credit at all.
 2. Please address your concerns with a particular project to the appropriate project series channel (e.g. if you are reporting a bad WU for project 9411, please post to channel #9400).
 3. Please note that this is a forum for beta testing and discussing technical issues about specific projects in realtime with the Pande Group. For more general inquiries, please refer to the [Folding Forum](https://foldingforum.org/). Those who abuse the Folding@home Slack (e.g. complain about points, PG, etc.) will be promptly banned.


For PG
------

 1. Under "What I Do" in your account profile, please make some reference to the Pande Group. Setting your avatar to the [Stanford logo](http://logonoid.com/images/stanford-university-logo.png) would also be ideal to distinguish yourself as a PG member.
 2. Keep your "channel topic" up to date with active projects. Include
    OS, CPU/GPU, FAH status, and project keys.
 3. Keep the general "channel topic" up to date with your 
    active projects. Include the same information as in #2. Conversely, if there are no internal projects to be tested, please indicate this and refer users to the Beta Forum.
 4. When advancing a project to Beta, please give internal users at least a day's notice.
