Slack Guidelines
================

 1. Be civil

For Donors
----------

 1. Projects marked "internal" and "beta" are not guaranteed to receive accurate credit. `INTERNAL` projects may not recieve any credit at all.
 1. Please address your concerns with a particular project to the appropriate project series channel (e.g. if you are reporting a bad WU for project 9411, please post to channel #9400).
 1. Please note that this is a forum for beta testing and discussing technical issues about specific projects in realtime with the Pande Group. For more general inquiries, please refer to the [Folding Forum](https://foldingforum.org/). Those who abuse the Folding@home Slack (e.g. complain about points, PG, etc.) will be promptly banned.


For Project Managers
--------------------

 1. Under "What I Do" in your account profile, please make some reference to your group and organization. Setting your avatar to the your organization's logo (e.g. [the Stanford logo](http://logonoid.com/images/stanford-university-logo.png)) would also be ideal to distinguish yourself as a project manager.
 1. Create your channel in accordance with your assigned project series (e.g. if you own the 94XX series, please create a #9400 channel). This keeps communication more or less organized, without the need for hundreds of different channels.
 1. Keep your "channel topic" up to date with active projects. Include
    `OS`, `core`, FAH status, and `ProjectKey`.
 1. Keep the general "channel topic" up to date with your 
    active projects. Include the same information as in #2. Conversely, if there are no internal projects to be tested, please indicate this and refer users to the `BETA` Forum.
 1. Configure your workserver to assign to at least both `INTERNAL` _and_ `BETA` while your project is on `INTERNAL`. This makes it easier for the donors report points estimates from [`HFM.NET`](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hfm-net/).
 1. When advancing a project to `BETA`, please give internal users at least a day's notice.
