Slack Guidelines
================

 1. Be civil

For Donors
----------

 1. Projects marked "internal" and "beta" are not guaranteed to receive accurate credit. "internal" projects may not recieve any credit at all.
 1. Please address your concerns with a particular project to the appropriate project series channel (e.g. if you are reporting a bad WU for project 9411, please post to channel #9400).
 1. Please note that this is a forum for beta testing and discussing technical issues about specific projects in realtime with the Pande Group. For more general inquiries, please refer to the [Folding Forum](https://foldingforum.org/). Those who abuse the Folding@home Slack (e.g. complain about points, PG, etc.) will be promptly banned.


For PG
------

 1. Under "What I Do" in your account profile, please make some reference to the Pande Group. Setting your avatar to the [Stanford logo](http://logonoid.com/images/stanford-university-logo.png) would also be ideal to distinguish yourself as a PG member.
 1. Create your channel in accordance with your assigned project series (e.g. if you own the 94XX series, please create a #9400 channel). This keeps communication more or less organized, without the need for hundreds of different channels.
 1. Keep your "channel topic" up to date with active projects. Include
    OS, CPU/GPU, FAH status, and project keys.
